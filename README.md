How to run the app:
    Run the main Flask module by running `python3 PizzaParlour.py`
    Next, run main.py in parallel by running `python3 main.py`
    You can also run the app in Pycharm by running PizzaParlour.py and Main.py
    in parallel

How to run tests:
    Run unit tests with coverage by running:
    pytest --cov-report term --cov=. tests/unit_tests.py
    Do not run this while PizzaParlour.py or main.py is active.
    This should be run on its own.
